# ![RealWorld Example App](project-logo.png)

> ### [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.


### [Demo](TODO add production url)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/)** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
